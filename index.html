I am writing this message on Sunday, October 6th, 2024 at 7:15AM.

A long time ago, on March 18, 2023,
I gave you guys a handout.

Your name was on it and your account for hammymathclass.

HammyMathClass: Online math assignments and stories.

It has been 568 days since then.

Where is hammymathclass?
What has Mr. Lee been doing???

I'm really sorry.
I don't have an excuse.

I'm going to start now.

The website wont be that good.
But I'll keep working on it.

The next update will be on November 1st, 2024.
This time, I promise the update will happen. 

Even if I got nothing done, I'll write an update.



I remember all of your names.

I remember all of your faces.

I think about you guys all the time.


Sincerely,

Mr. Lee
