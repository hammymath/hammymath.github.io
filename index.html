            <p><strong>Mr. Lee:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>
            <p>That's what you said last month.</p>
            <p><strong>Mr. Lee:</strong> I know. But at least I wrote an update?</p>
            <p>I guess that's better than nothing. December 1st, 2024. You have to have to have to have to do it for December 1st, 2024. Okay?</p>

        <h2>Post 1</h2>
        <p>I am writing this message on Sunday, October 6th, 2024 at 7:15AM.</p>
        <p>A long time ago, on March 18, 2023, I gave you guys a handout.</p>
        <p>Your name was on it and your account for hammymathclass.</p>
        <p><strong>HammyMathClass:</strong> Online math assignments and stories.</p>
        <p>It has been 568 days since then.</p>
        <p>Where is hammymathclass? What has Mr. Lee been doing???</p>
        <p>I'm really sorry. I don't have an excuse.</p>
        <p>I'm going to start now.</p>
        <p>The website won't be that good. But I'll keep working on it.</p>
        <p>The next update will be on November 1st, 2024. This time, I promise the update will happen.</p>
        <p>Even if I got nothing done, I'll write an update.</p>
        <p>I remember all of you and hope you are doing well.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee</p>
