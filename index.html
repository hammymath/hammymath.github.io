I am writing this message on Sunday, October 6th, 2024 at 7:15AM.

A long time ago, on March 18, 2023,
I gave you guys a handout.

Your name was on it and your account for hammymathclass.

HammyMathClass: Online math assignments and stories.

It has been 568 days since then.

Where is hammymathclass?
What has Mr. Lee been doing???

I'm really sorry.
I don't have an excuse.

I'm going to start now.

The website wont be that good.
But I'll keep working on it.
Little by little, I believe hammymathclass will become a good website.


I remember all of your names.

I remember all of your faces.

I hope all of you are doing well.


Sincerely,

Mr. Lee
