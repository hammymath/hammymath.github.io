A long time ago, 
Saturday,
March 18, 2023,

I gave you guys a handout.

Your name was on it.
And your account ... for hammymathclass.
HammyMathClass: Online math assignments and stories.

It has been 568 days since then.

Where is hammymathclass?
What has Mr. Lee been doing???

I'm sorry.
I don't have an excuse.

I'm going to start now.
Little by little, I will do my best.



Sincerely,

Mr. Lee
