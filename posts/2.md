hi everyone, 

i hope all of you are doing well.

i have 2 new math stories! 
they are both about percentages, 
but the second one goes a little deeper.
    
* grade 6: [percentages i]
* grade 7: [percentages ii]

the stories are okay.
but i think they can be better.
i'll try to make them better next month.


wishing you a happy halloween!

mr. lee
